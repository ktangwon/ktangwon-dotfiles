1 Building and Installing
*************************

Note: Currently installation is supported for Emacs only.  XEmacs users
might want to refer to the RefTeX package available through the package
system of XEmacs.

Installation with make
======================

In order to install RefTeX, unpack the distribution and edit the header
of the Makefile.  Basically, you need to change the path specifications
for Emacs Lisp files and info files.  Also, enter the name of your Emacs
executable (usually either `emacs' or `xemacs').

   Then, type

     make
     make install

   to compile and install the code and documentation.

   Per default RefTeX is installed in its own subdirectory which might
not be on your load path.  In this case, add it to load path with a
command like the following, replacing the sample directory with the one
where RefTeX is installed in your case.

     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/reftex")

   Put this command into your init file before other RefTeX-related
settings.

Installation by Hand
====================

If you want to get your hands dirty, there is also the possibility to
install by manually copying files.

  a. Copy the reftex*.el lisp files to a directory on your load path.
     Make sure that no old copy of RefTeX shadows these files.

  b. Byte compile the files.  The sequence of compiling should be:
     reftex-var.el, reftex.el, and then all the others.

  c. Copy the info file reftex.info to the info directory.

2 Loading RefTeX
****************

In order to make the most important functions for entering RefTeX mode
available add the following line to your init file.

     (require 'reftex)

3 Entering RefTeX Mode
**********************

To turn RefTeX Mode on and off in a particular buffer, use `M-x
reftex-mode <RET>'.  To turn on RefTeX Mode for all LaTeX files, add
the following lines to your `.emacs' file:

     (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'turn-on-reftex)   ; with AUCTeX LaTeX mode
     (add-hook 'latex-mode-hook 'turn-on-reftex)   ; with Emacs latex mode

   That's all!

   To get started, read the documentation, in particular the section
RefTeX in a Nutshell in the manual.

   In order to produce a printed version of the documentation, use
`make pdf' to produce a reftex.pdf file.  Analogously you can use the
`dvi', `ps', or `html' targets to create DVI, PostScript or HTML files.

4 Environment
*************

RefTeX needs to access all files which are part of a multifile
document, and the BibTeX database files requested by the
`\bibliography' command.  To find these files, RefTeX will require a
search path, i.e. a list of directories to check.  Normally this list
is stored in the environment variables `TEXINPUTS' and `BIBINPUTS'
which are also used by RefTeX.  However, on some systems these
variables do not contain the full search path.  If RefTeX does not work
for you because it cannot find some files, see the section Finding
Files in the manual.
