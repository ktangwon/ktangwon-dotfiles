Here is a list of recent changes to RefTeX.

Version 4.34

   * The creation of BibTeX files with `reftex-create-bibtex-file' now
     recognizes cross-referenced entries and `@string' definitions.

   * RefTeX now provides better options for defining and selecting
     special referencing macros like `\vref' from the `varioref'
     package, `\fref' from the `fancyref' package or `\autoref' from
     the `hyperref' package as well as page-referencing macros like
     `\pageref'.  See section Reference Styles in the manual for
     details.

Version 4.33

   * Update to GPLv3.

   * Parse files are created in a way that does not interfere with
     recentf mode.

Version 4.32

   * First release by AUCTeX project.

   * Installation routine rewritten after structure of source package
     changed.

   * Activation of RefTeX changed, so make sure you read the
     installation instructions and remove obsolete cruft related to
     RefTeX from your init file.

   * Fixed bug where point would end up in the wrong buffer when jumping
     between several LaTeX and phrases buffers.

   * Fixed bug where BibTeX keys with hyphens were parsed incorrectly.

   * Some performance improvements.

   * The separator used between multiple citations in a \cite macro can
     now be changed by customizing the variable
     `reftex-cite-key-separator'.

Version 4.28

   * Support for the Jurabib package.

   * Improvements when selecting several items in a selection buffer.

Version 4.27

   * Support for jurabib in `reftex-cite-format-builtin'.

   * Bug fixes.

Version 4.26

   * Support for global incremental search.

   * Some improvements for XEmacs compatibility.

Version 4.25

   * Fixed bug with `%F' in a label prefix.  Added new escapes `%m' and
     `%M' for mater file name and master directory.

Version 4.24

   * Inserting citation commands now prompts for optional arguments
     when called with a prefix argument.  Related new options are
     `reftex-cite-prompt-optional-args' and
     `reftex-cite-cleanup-optional-args'.

   * New option `reftex-trust-label-prefix'.  Configure this variable
     if you'd like RefTeX to base its classification of labels on
     prefixes.  This can speed-up document parsing, but may in some
     cases reduce the quality of the context used by RefTeX to describe
     a label.

   * Fixed bug in `reftex-create-bibtex-file' when
     `reftex-comment-citations' is non-nil.

   * Fixed bugs in indexing: Case-sensitive search, quotes before and/or
     after words.  Disabled indexing in comment lines.

Version 4.22

   * New command `reftex-create-bibtex-file' to create a new database
     with all entries referenced in the current document.

   * New keys `e' and `E' allow to produce a BibTeX database file from
     entries marked in a citation selection buffer.

Version 4.21

   * Renaming labels from the toc buffer with key `M-%'.

Version 4.20

   * Structure editing capabilities.  The command keys `<' and `>' in
     the TOC buffer promote/demote the section at point or all sections
     in the current region.

   * New option `reftex-toc-split-windows-fraction' to set the size of
     the window used by the TOC.  This makes the old variable
     `reftex-toc-split-windows-horizontally-fraction' obsolete.

   * A dedicated frame can show the TOC with the current section always
     automatically highlighted.  The frame is created and deleted from
     the toc buffer with the `d' key.

Version 4.19

   * New command `reftex-toc-recenter' (`C-c -') which shows the current
     section in the TOC buffer without selecting the TOC window.

   * Recentering happens automatically in idle time when the option
     `reftex-auto-recenter-toc' is turned on.

   * Fixed several bugs related to automatic cursor positioning in the
     TOC buffer.

   * The highlight in the TOC buffer stays when the focus moves to a
     different window.

   * New command `reftex-goto-label'.

   * Part numbers are no longer included in chapter numbers, and a new
     part does not reset the chapter counter.  See new option
     `reftex-part-resets-chapter'.

Version 4.18

   * `reftex-citation' uses the word before the cursor as a default
     search string.

   * Simplified several regular expressions for speed.

   * Better support for chapterbib.  Different chapters can now use
     BibTeX or an explicit `thebibliography' environment.

Version 4.17

   * The toc window can be split off horizontally.  See new options
     `reftex-toc-split-windows-horizontally',
     `reftex-toc-split-windows-horizontally-fraction'.

   * It is possible to specify a function which verifies an index match
     during global indexing.  See new option
     `reftex-index-verify-function'.

   * The macros which input a file in LaTeX (like \input, \include) can
     be configured.  See new option `reftex-include-file-commands'.

   * The macros which specify the bibliography file (like
     \bibliography) can be configured.  See new option
     `reftex-bibliography-commands'.

   * The regular expression used to search for the \bibliography macro
     has been relaxed to allow for `{\bibliography{...}}' needed by
     chapterbib.

   * Small bug fixes.

Version 4.15

   * Fixed bug with parsing of BibTeX files, when fields contain quotes
     or unmatched parenthesis.

   * Small bug fixes.

   * Improved interaction with Emacs LaTeX mode.

Version 4.14

   * Ensure write access to all files before doing global label replace.

   * Fixed bug which would parse `\partial' as `\part'.

Version 4.12

   * Support for `bibentry' citation style.

Version 4.11

   * Fixed bug which would parse `\Section' just like `\section'.

Version 4.10

   * Renamed `reftex-vcr.el' to `reftex-dcr.el' because of conflict
     with `reftex-vars.el' on DOS machines.

   * New options `reftex-parse-file-extension' and
     `reftex-index-phrase-file-extension'.
