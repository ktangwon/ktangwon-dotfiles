Release Notes for RefTeX 4.34 (2009-08-09)
==========================================

RefTeX is a specialized package for support of labels, references,
citations, and the index in LaTeX.  RefTeX wraps itself around four
LaTeX macros: \label, \ref, \cite, and \index.  Using these macros
usually requires looking up different parts of the document and
searching through BibTeX database files.  RefTeX automates these
time-consuming tasks almost entirely.  It also provides functions to
display the structure of a document and to move around in this
structure quickly.

New Features and Bug Fixes
--------------------------

Reference styles make it easier to use special referencing macros as
provided by the `varioref', `fancyref' or `hyperref' LaTeX packages.
The creation of BibTeX files with `reftex-create-bibtex-file' now
recognizes cross-referenced entries and @string definitions.  See also
the CHANGES file for a description of other changes.
